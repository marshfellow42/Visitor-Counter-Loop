# Visitor-Counter-Loop
In this script you input your GitHub profile and it keep refreshing the webpage for you

Just so it increases your profile visitor count artificially

But it requires PyAutoGUI for it to work properly

To install PyAutoGUI, use this command on the terminal

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

This script is just a POC

Use it as you'd like to
